# Superstore-Sales
An interactive sales dashboard based on a real retail dataset

Questions to answer:
1.What are the most profitable categories and subcategories?
2.Which regions and cities bring in the most sales?
3.How are sales evolving month by month?
4.Is there a correlation between discount and profit?

Conclusion:

“We analyzed the relationship between Discount and Profit and found that large discounts almost always lead to losses. The correlation matrix confirms this, showing a negative correlation between Discount and Profit. My recommendation would be to optimize the discount policy, to avoid decreasing profit margins.”
